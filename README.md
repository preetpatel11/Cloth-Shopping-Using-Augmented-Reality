# Cloth-Shopping-Using-Augmented-Reality

In this project, we have implemented clothes augmentation on the human body where you can try various types of clothes virtually and for that, we have made an e-commerce website. When you select virtual mode, the camera scans your body by using OpenCV to determine its coordinates and then augments selected clothing on the body.
This project was done with a team following Scrum.
